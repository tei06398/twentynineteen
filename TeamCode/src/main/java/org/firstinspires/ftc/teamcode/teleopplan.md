# Plan for TeleOp Operations


## Adjust Driving and Gunner Code for New Chassis
- Add Sweeper and Arm Integration
  - Servos need to turn to lift the arm and turn the sweeper. Separate function for each with power input for each to be determined.

- Arm Lift and Transfer of Balls and Cubes
  - Servos need to have a function for continuously picking up and transferring balls to the target.


## Program Instructions for Robot Arm and Winch
- Add Proper Power Adjustments and Movement
  - May need to program power adjustments for the arm winch to better control ball and cube movement.


## Sweeper Mechanism Programming
- Proper Control and Power
  - Need to give sweeper enough power to sweep up materials, but not so much that the sweepers move without the axle.

- Allow Adjustment of Power


## Create Intuitive Mapping of Functions for Controller
- New Arm Controls
  - Need to figure out a suitable config for arm, maybe X to start lift, B to start transfer.

- New Sweeper Controls (Adjustable Power)
  - Program Triggers to control the sweeper? May need buttons to adjust speed, start, and end sweeper function.
